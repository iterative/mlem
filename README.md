MLEM helps you package and deploy machine learning models.
It saves ML models in a standard format that can be used in a variety of production scenarios such as real-time REST serving or batch processing.

- **Run your ML models anywhere:**
  Wrap models as a Python package or Docker Image, or deploy them to Heroku, SageMaker or Kubernetes (more platforms coming soon).
  Switch between platforms transparently, with a single command.

- **Model metadata into YAML automatically:**
  Automatically include Python requirements and input data needs into a human-readable, deployment-ready format.
  Use the same metafile on any ML framework.

- **Stick to your training workflow:**
  MLEM doesn't ask you to rewrite model training code.
  Add just two lines around your Python code: one to import the library and one to save the model.

- **Developer-first experience:**
  Use the CLI when you feel like DevOps, or the API if you feel like a developer.

## Why is MLEM special?

The main reason to use MLEM instead of other tools is to adopt a **GitOps approach** to manage model lifecycles.

- **Git as a single source of truth:**
  MLEM writes model metadata to a plain text file that can be versioned in Git along with code.
  This enables GitFlow and other software engineering best practices.

- **Unify model and software deployment:**
  Release models using the same processes used for software updates (branching, pull requests, etc.).

- **Reuse existing Git infrastructure:**
  Use familiar hosting like Github or Gitlab for model management, instead of having separate services.

- **UNIX philosophy:**
  MLEM is a modular tool that solves one problem very well.
  It integrates well into a larger toolset from Iterative.ai, such as [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [CML](https://cml.dev/).

## Usage

This a quick walkthrough showcasing deployment functionality of MLEM.

Please read [Get Started guide](https://mlem.ai/doc/get-started) for a full version.

### Installation

MLEM requires Python 3.

```console
$ python -m pip install mlem
```

> To install the pre-release version:
>
> ```console
> $ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/iterative/mlem
> ```

### Saving the model

```python
# train.py
from mlem.api import save
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

def main():
    data, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
    rf = RandomForestClassifier(
        n_jobs=2,
        random_state=42,
    )
    rf.fit(data, y)

    save(
        rf,
        "models/rf",
        sample_data=data,
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Codification

```shell
$ ls models/

rf.mlem
$ cat rf.mlem

### Deploying the model

If you want to follow this Quick Start, you'll need to sign up on https://heroku.com,
create an API_KEY and populate `HEROKU_API_KEY` env var (or run `heroku login` in command line).
Besides, you'll need to run `heroku container:login`. This will log you in to Heroku
container registry.

Now we can [deploy the model with `mlem deploy`](https://mlem.ai/doc/get-started/deploying)
(you need to use different `app_name`, since it's going to be published on https://herokuapp.com):

```shell
$ mlem deployment run heroku app.mlem \
  --model models/rf \
  --app_name example-mlem-get-started-app
